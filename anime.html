                        I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
                        Midnights become my afternoons
                        When my depression works the graveyard shift
                        All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room

                        I should not be left to my own devices
                        They come with prices and vices
                        I end up in crisis
                        (Tale as old as time)

                        I wake up screaming from dreaming
                        One day I'll watch as you're leaving
                        'Cause you got tired of my scheming
                        (For the last time)

                        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
                        At teatime, everybody agrees
                        I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror
                        It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

                        Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
                        And I'm a monster on the hill
                        Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
                        Pierced through the heart, but never killed

                        Did you hear my covert narcissism
                        Lightly disguised as altruism
                        Like some kind of congressman?
                        (Tale as old as time)

                        I wake up screaming from dreaming
                        One day I'll watch as you're leaving
                        And life will lose all of its meaning
                        (For the last time)

                        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
                        At teatime, everybody agrees
                        I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror
                        It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

                        I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
                        She thinks I left them in the will
                        The family gathers around and reads it and someone screams out
                        She's laughing up at us from hell

                        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
                        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
                        It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees

                        It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
                        At teatime, everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
                        I'll stare directly at the Sun, but never in the mirror
                        It must be exhausting, always rooting for the anti-hero

                    <p style="margin: 20px; margin-left: 50px;"> Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
                        You know that I caught it (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)
                        Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
                        You know that I bought it (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)

                        Killing me slow, out the window
                        I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
                        Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
                        What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

                        And it's new, the shape of your body
                        It's blue, the feeling I've got
                        And it's ooh, whoa oh
                        It's a cruel summer
                        It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
                        No rules in breakable heaven
                        But ooh, whoa oh
                        It's a cruel summer
                        With you

                        Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
                        I'm not dying (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)
                        You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
                        We're not trying (oh, yeah, you're right, I want it)

                        So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
                        I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
                        Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
                        And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

                        Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
                        It's blue, the feeling I've got
                        And it's ooh, whoa oh
                        It's a cruel summer
                        It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
                        No rules in breakable heaven
                        But ooh, whoa oh
                        It's a cruel summer
                        With you

                        I'm drunk in the back of the car
                        And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
                        Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true
                        I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
                        And I snuck in through the garden gate
                        Every night that summer, just to seal my fate (oh)
                        And I screamed for whatever it's worth
                        I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
                        He looks up, grinning like a devil

                        And it's new, the shape of your body
                        It's blue, the feeling I've got
                        And it's ooh, whoa oh
                        It's a cruel summer
                        It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
                        No rules in breakable heaven
                        But ooh, whoa oh
                        It's a cruel summer
                        With you

                        I'm drunk in the back of the car
                        And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
                        Said I'm fine, but it wasn't true

                        Vintage tee, brand-new phone
                        High heels on cobblestones
                        When you are young, they assume you know nothing
                        Sequin smile, black lipstick
                        Sensual politics
                        When you are young, they assume you know nothing

                        But I knew you
                        Dancin' in your Levi's
                        Drunk under a streetlight, I
                        I knew you
                        Hand under my sweatshirt
                        Baby, kiss it better, I

                        And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
                        Under someone's bed
                        You put me on and said I was your favorite

                        A friend to all is a friend to none
                        Chase two girls, lose the one
                        When you are young, they assume you know nothing

                        But I knew you
                        Playing hide-and-seek and
                        Giving me your weekends, I
                        I knew you
                        Your heartbeat on the High Line
                        Once in twenty lifetimes, I

                        And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
                        Under someone's bed
                        You put me on and said I was your favorite

                        To kiss in cars and downtown bars
                        Was all we needed
                        You drew stars around my scars
                        But now I'm bleedin'

                        'Cause I knew you
                        Steppin' on the last train
                        Marked me like a bloodstain, I
                        I knew you
                        Tried to change the ending
                        Peter losing Wendy, I
                        I knew you
                        Leavin' like a father
                        Running like water, I
                        And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

                        But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
                        I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
                        The smell of smoke would hang around this long
                        'Cause I knew everything when I was young
                        I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
                        Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
                        I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
                        And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
                        And I knew you'd come back to me
                        You'd come back to me
                        And you'd come back to me
                        And you'd come back

                        And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
                        Under someone's bed
                        You put me on and said I was your favorite</p>
