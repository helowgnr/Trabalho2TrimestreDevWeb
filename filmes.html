                        You say: I don't understand, and I say: I know you don't
                        We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
                        Remember looking at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light
                        Now I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time
                        
                        Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
                        I'm getting tired, even for a phoenix
                        Always rising from the ashes
                        Mending all her gashes
                        You might just have dealt the final blow
                        
                        Stop, you're losing me
                        Stop, you're losing me
                        Stop, you're losing me
                        I can't find a pulse
                        My heart won't start anymore
                        For you
                        'Cause you're losing me
                        
                        Every morning, I glared at you with storms in my eyes
                        How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dying?
                        I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
                        My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick
                        
                        And the air is thick with loss and indecision
                        I know my pain is such an imposition
                        Now, you're running down the hallway
                        And you know what they all say
                        You don't know what you got until it's gone

                        I can see you standing, honey
                        With his arms around your body
                        Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all

                        And it took you five whole minutes
                        To pack us up and leave me with it
                        Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

                        I think I've seen this film before
                        And I didn't like the ending
                        You're not my homeland anymore
                        So what am I defending now?
                        You were my town
                        Now I'm in exile, seein' you out
                        I think I've seen this film before

                        I can see you starin', honey
                        Like he's just your understudy
                        Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me

                        Second, third, and hundredth chances
                        Balancin' on breaking branches
                        Those eyes add insult to injury

                        I think I've seen this film before
                        And I didn't like the ending
                        I'm not your problem anymore
                        So who am I offending now?
                        You were my crown
                        Now I'm in exile, seein' you out
                        I think I've seen this film before
                        So I'm leavin' out the side door

                        So step right out, there is no amount
                        Of crying I can do for you

                        All this time
                        We always walked a very thin line
                        You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
                        You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

                        All this time
                        I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
                        I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
                        'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

                        So many signs, so many signs
                        You didn't even see the signs

                        Midnight
                        You come and pick me up, no headlights
                        A long drive
                        Could end in burning flames or paradise

                        Fade into view, oh
                        It's been a while since I have even heard from you
                        (Heard from you)

                        And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
                        Know exactly where it leads, but I
                        Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

                        You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
                        And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
                        And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
                        'Cause we never go out of style
                        We never go out of style

                        You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
                        And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
                        And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
                        'Cause we never go out of style
                        We never go out of style

                        So it goes
                        He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
                        Takes me home
                        The lights are off, he's taking off his coat

                        I say: I heard, oh
                        That you've been out and about with some other girl
                        (Some other girl)

                        He says: What you heard is true, but I
                        Can't stop thinking about you, and I
                        I said: I've been there too, a few times
